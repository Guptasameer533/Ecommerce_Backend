# E-commerce Platform with AI Recommendations

Hey there! This is my Django project for an e-commerce platform with a cool AI-powered product recommendation system. I've also used Cython to optimize some computationally heavy parts of the code for better performance.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd ecommerce-project
```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

4. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Apply the database migrations:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

6. Create a superuser account (for accessing the admin panel):

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

7. Finally, start the development server:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Now you should be able to access the e-commerce platform by visiting `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## Features
